# BUILDING USER PROFILES WITH CERAMIC NETWORK: LEARNWEB3DAO JUNIOR TRACK

Ceramic is a decentralized data network, that allows for building composable Web3 applications. Since Ceramic decentralizes application databases, application developers can reuse data across applications and make them automatically interoperable. A 3ID is a user's decentralized identity on the Ceramic Network

This project demonstrates a simple Next.js application, which uses Self.ID. It allow users to login to the website using their wallet of choice, which will be linked to their 3ID. Then, the user will be able to write some data (name) to their decentralized profile, be able to retrieve it from the Ceramic Network and also update it.

To interact with this frontend, you need to connect your wallet to the application (goerli for this demo). Then in the input box, you need to write your name and set it so you will be welcomed with your name. You can then decide to update the name to whatever you like.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
